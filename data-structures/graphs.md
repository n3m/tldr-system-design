## Data Structures: Graphs

#### Features:
- Consists of nodes (vertices) that can be connected in arbitrary ways
- Traversal Strategies
  - BFS (Breadth First Search) (Most used because of deep access)
    - Going from the top analyzing the connections
  - DFS (Depth First Search)
- Read is O(V+E)
  - Sum of the number of vertices + number of edges

#### Applications:
 - Friends in social networks, paths in a city, networks in general.
