## Basic Concepts: Data Retrieval

### TF-IDF - Document Search

Stands for Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency
- Important data for search - figures out what terms are most relevant for a document.
- Term Frequency
  - Measures how often a word occurs in a document. (A work that occurs frequently, maybe it's important)
- Document Frequency
  - Is how often a workd occurs in an entire set of documents

If you take the Term Frequency and divided by Document Frequency, you get the __Relevancy of a word is to the document__

#### Usecases
- Search
  - Compute and sort a document by the TF-IDF
